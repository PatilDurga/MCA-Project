Stock Market Price prediction is a Machine Learning Project using Python.
Implement the Algorithm which predict stock market price using LSTM model .
It has a stock ticker where user can mention the speciÔ¨Åc company 's ticker(stock ticker name of
company) and then this program analyze that company's past year stock and predict the stock
price trend weather it goes up or down.
For the prediction of the of closeing price trend I have used data from 2010 - 2020 from Yahoo Finance where the diffrent company stocks data is avilable . using this data I created a trained model name as keras_model.h5 and using that the model Predicts the stock tend  for diffrent company.
With this the code also gives the graphical representation for the 100 days moving avrage as well as 200 days moving avrage to the user for specified company.
